# ITE222---Programming-II

This repository has a final group academic project "Stamford Hospital application development with the database system." with its presentation in the form of a report. The repository also consists of assignments  that covers the majority of the topics studied throughout the course.

This course continues the practice of algorithmic problem solving as well as structured and object-oriented programming. Topics include:  problem analysis and decomposition, stepwise refinement, pseudocode and charting techniques, basic control structures and data types, classes and objects, modularization and parameter passing, files, user interfaces, arrays, testing, program tracing and debugging. Principles of software engineering and object-oriented design, two of a professional programmer's primary methodologies, are introduced and applied. There are extensive programming assignments due every week, which require out-of-class computer use. This course requires a considerable investment of time; however you will find that the general problem-solving and application development skills you master in this course will build an invaluable foundation for all later courses in ITE as well as for other aspects of your lives.
